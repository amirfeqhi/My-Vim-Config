# Vim Configuration

Vim is a command-line base text editor and it’s so powerful, fast and flexible.
Also, Vim is my favorite and default editor for coding. Frankly, I must
admit that is hard to understand at the very first glance but believe it
or not it’s going to be one of your best friends after a while.

Vim has some configuration underneath the hood. As I said before it’s so flexible and it’s mean you can have a lot of features if you want.

There is a file called “.vimrc” which is wrapped up all of your configs.

I thought sharing my Vim config could be helpful, and also It’s a shortcut for someone who wants to start using it.

At the end it should look like this:
